[![Dependency Status](https://david-dm.org/zombiQWERTY/angular-component-way-webpack-starter-kit/status.svg)](https://david-dm.org/zombiQWERTY/angular-component-way-webpack-starter-kit#info=dependencies) [![devDependency Status](https://david-dm.org/zombiQWERTY/angular-component-way-webpack-starter-kit/dev-status.svg)](https://david-dm.org/zombiQWERTY/angular-component-way-webpack-starter-kit#info=devDependencies)

A complete, yet simple, component-way starter for Angular using Webpack.

This workflow serves as a starting point for building Angular 1.x applications using Webpack. Should be noted that apart from the pre-installed angular package, this workflow is pretty much generic.

* Heavily commented webpack configuration with reasonable defaults.
* Based on component way (even styles).
* ES6, and ES7 support with babel.
* Source maps included in all builds.
* Development server with live reload.
* Production builds with cache busting.
* PostCSS and jade support by default.
* Testing environment using karma to run tests and jasmine as the framework; protractor to End to End tests.
* Code coverage when tests are run.
* No gulp and no grunt, just npm scripts.
* Generic components via plop.

>Warning: Make sure you're using the latest version of Node.js and NPM

### Installing

```bash
# clone our repo
$ git clone https://github.com/zombiQWERTY/angular-component-way-webpack-starter-kit.git my-app

# change directory to your app
$ cd my-app

# install the dependencies with npm
$ npm install

# install selenium-webdriver (for e2e testing)
$ npm run selenium-install

# start the server
$ npm start
```

# Getting Started

## Dependencies

What you need to run this app:
* `node` and `npm` (Use [NVM](https://github.com/creationix/nvm))
* Ensure you're running Node (`v4.1.x`+) and NPM (`2.14.x`+)

## Running the app

After you have installed all dependencies you can now run the app with:
```bash
npm start
```

It will start a local server using `webpack-dev-server` which will watch, build (in-memory), and reload for you. The port will be displayed to you as `http://localhost:8080`.

## Developing

### Build files

* single run: `npm run build`

## Testing

#### 1. Unit Tests

* single run: `npm run test`
* live mode (TDD style): `npm run test-watch`


#### 2. End to End Tests
* run `npm run selenium-start` and then:
* single run: `npm run e2e` or
* live mode (TDD style): `npm run e2e-watch`

## Other

* `npm run plop` for generating files
* `npm run stats` for code analysing ([webpack.github.io/analyse](https://webpack.github.io/analyse/))
* Store your content (images, etc.) that loads from html/jade in [assets folder](./src/assets/) folder
